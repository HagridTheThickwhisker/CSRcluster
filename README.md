------

#how to use
1.import this whole project to eclipse <br>
2.open the integration.All.java       <br>
3.create a floder,and put DataSource.txt && k.txt in it <br>
4.run the three_in_one function to finish these steps below <br>
    first:calculate the TF-IDF matrix
    second:change the matrix to CSR matrix ,then run the cluster function,and find the best K
    third:divide the DataSource into several txts,and find everyone's keywords and hot questions

## after this, you should put a  Classname.txt into your floder,then run the last function
5.run the fourth function to finish the tag progress<br>
